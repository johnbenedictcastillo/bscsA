# LOGO: App Animator and Identifier using Augmented Reality

 **Project Description:**

>This app is developed or created in order to help the students to quickly identify the college logo and at the same time, animating it. It can show or animate something about the college, in order to have an idea on that College.
If someone know nothing about the logo/college, they can use this app to scan the logo or the word/Acronym like “CCS, CCJE, CTE, CA, CAS, or CBMA”

**Market Analysis:**

>This app is suitable for the students and parents of LSPU Siniloan Campus only. And it can be access through smartphones. With the use of this app, you can see the animation of the different logos and it can get you some idea or information about the scanned logo/acronym. 
  
**Risk Analysis:**
	
>The only problem that they might encounter is failed to scan or read the logo/acronym due to the quality of the camera, poor internet connection and no internet access.
